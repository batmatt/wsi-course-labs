# wsi-course-labs
Following repository contains implementations from scratch of 6 AI-related algorithms prepared in Python 3.8.

# Covered topics
1. Optimization algorithms (steepest descend, Newton's method) 
2. Evolutionary algorithms on Travelling Salesman Problem example
3. Zero-sum games (Minimax algorithm) on Reversi example
4. Logic programming on Einstein's riddle
5. Bayesian Modelling (Naive Bayes classifier) on iris types dataset analisys
6. Regression and classification (Random Forest) on car's values dataset analisys

Every subfolder has _raport-lab-x_ pdf file containing problem's analisys, documentation, results and conclusion written in Polish.
